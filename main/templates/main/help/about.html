                Students frequently experience burnout as a result of the continual pouring of academic requirements associated 
            with the implementation of distance learning. Our team would like to suggest a solution that will significantly 
            aid these individuals in increasing their productivity by organizing their requirements and reminding them of 
            approaching deadlines and to-do lists. Moreover, most productivity applications have features that are deemed 
            insufficient, forcing students to use multiple applications at once. 
            <br> <br>
                Hence, the Daily Note team created an <span style="font-weight: bold;"> All-in-One Note Taking and Reminder Web Application</span> that 
            would provide students with exceptional productivity tools in one application.
